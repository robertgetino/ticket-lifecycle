In Step 1, I change the SysAdmins Department to a Top Level Department. I then delete the Maintenance Department and do not archive.

In Step 2 of the project, I create a ticket for a customer stating that the mobile banking system is down. In this instance, the priority is normal and is assigned to the Support Department. Therefore, the ticket should only take about an hour to complete and set to the Sysadmins property.

<p>
In the last step of this project, I create another ticket describing that the CFO's laptop will not turn on and this is considered also a normal priority and I describe what the customer did in order to attempt to troubleshoot the issue.
