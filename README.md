A ticket is created for the network system is completely down for the company. The customer, Karen, writes this to the help desk. I log in as the admin and see the ticket go through the osTicket system. I open up the ticket and observe the details and specifics about the ticket such as the type of SLA, department and the priority level. Next, I assign it to one of the agents, in this case, Jane Smith. She then can view the ticket and update it with comments as well as steps that she takes to address the issue. In this case, the company just needed a new router. Jane is able to close the ticket as "Resolved".

Very similarly to the previous ticket above, Karen, the end user, creates another ticket that the "HR department needs a software update". She creates a ticket on osTicket and the ticket gets sent to the administrator, which is me. I then assign it to another agent, John Smith, who can also view and edit the ticket as it progresses. John is able to remotely log into all of the HR department computers in order to update the software. He uses a provided administrator username and password. After each computer is updated, John also tests them to make sure there are no other issues, and there aren't. John closes the ticket as "Resolved".
